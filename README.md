# Binker's Construct

An opinionated port of Tinker's Construct for Babric (BTA Minecraft). Uses [halplibe](https://github.com/Turnip-Labs/bta-halplibe/releases).

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that this mod is being written pretty much from scratch (due to being ported from Forge to Babric), and is in very early alpha stages. Bugs ARE present. Features ARE missing. Breaking changes WILL happen. So please use the mod at this stage only for testing and contributing purposes, in worlds with cheats enabled.
